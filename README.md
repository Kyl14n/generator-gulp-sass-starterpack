# Gulp + Sass starterpack\

A Yeoman generator that creates a minimal Gulp and Sass front-end workflow.

Based off of [Nando Moreirame's Gulp generator](https://github.com/nandomoreirame/generator-gulp-boilerplate)

## Instructions

Install Yeoman globally: `npm install -g yo`

Then install the Gulp + Sass boilerplate generator globally: `npm install -g generator-gulp-sass-starterpack`

Navigate to a directory you want to generate the files in, then run `yo gulp-sass-starterpack`

To run, you will need to have the Gulp CLI also installed globally:
`npm install -g gulp-cli`

Then in the project root, run the website by running `gulp`.
